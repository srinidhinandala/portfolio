       <p> <h5> We worked on Scratch during our first week at Girls Who Code. This program is an introduction to coding that uses blocks
        to create animations on the stage. We learned about loops, vairables, functions, and conditionals while making interesting stories.

        <h3> Core 4 </h3>
        <h5> Variables </h5>
          <p> Variables contain data types that will store information that can be changed. Sometimes, a user will input a value that will 
        make the variable change </p> 
        <h5> Loops </h5>
          <p> Loops are a sequence of commands that is repeated indefinitely. A long block of code with repeated instructions can be condensed
        with the use of loops. </p> 
        <h5> Functions </h5>
          <p> Functions are steps of code that are versatile and can be used in multiple places. Instead of typing the same lines of code again,
        a function can be used for the same commands to work out. </p>
        
        <h4> Week Two: Python </h4>
          <p> In the second week, we started to learn how to use Python. We used the Turtle Library to create colorful shapes based on a user
        input. </p>
